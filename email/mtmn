Hello Lukas!

My name is Steven Liu and I'm an Australian hobby software engineer. 

I was browsing on AlternativeTo and saw your product, Spacedeck, listed as an alternative. I'm sorry to hear that Spacedeck is now closed, but I hope you got a lot out of it while it was running. 

I've always wondered what it would be like to pursue a software engineering startup career. I am currently only in University so I suppose that career is still open to me, but I am currently studying Robotics Engineering. To help inform my decisions better, I was hoping I could get some insight from your journey with this development process. If you wouldn't mind, could I ask you some questions over email about your experience? 

Thanks in advance,
Steven Liu

How did the project start? What was your initial aim setting out? What challenges did you face? What was the team structure like? If you had a second chance, what would you have done differently?
